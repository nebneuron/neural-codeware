To use the functions in this folder, follow these steps:
   (*) Ensure that the subdirectory 'cliquer' exists and contains the Cliquer source code.
       If not, the source code can be obtained at http://users.tkk.fi/pat/cliquer.html.
    * In MATLAB, run `mex -setup` to configure a compiler for MATLAB to use
        * You must choose from the provided list of compilers on your system; any (C compiler) should work.
    * From the MATLAB command line, execute the function `CompileCliquer`.
        * Running this command should compile the Cliquer routines and produce the MATLAB MEX
          interface to these routines, which should be named 'CliquerFindNumCliques.mex*', where '*'
          is dependent on your system.
        * At this point, all of the functions in this folder should be usable on your system.
          You can treat them as you would any other MATLAB function files.  (In fact, all of
          them are regular MATLAB function files except for `CliquerFindNumCliques.mex*`.)

These sites were helpful when setting up the compiler on my system:
    * http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-FR6LXJ/ (for compiling on kaluza/Mac)
    * https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB
    * http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~pcarbo/mex-tutorial/index.html
    * http://xcorr.net/2010/05/07/getting-gcc-to-work-with-matlab-r2009b-on-linux-ubuntu-karmic-to-compile-mex-files/
    * http://blog.syrus.us/2011/05/compiling-mex-files-on-ubuntu-1104.html

Sometimes we may need to run "!make clean" inside the cliquer directory ("!" if in matlab),
but that has also been built into "CompileCliquer" as of now.


MAIN FUNCTIONS........................................................

The core C routine is "CliquerFindNumCliques.c" and there is a companion
"dummy" .m file that has its documentation.  This is what gets compiled
by "CompileCliquer.m" to produce a .mex file of the same name.

The functions to actually use in Matlab are the following wrappers 
of CliquerFindNumcliques.c:

FindNumCliques.m
    Finds total number of cliques within a given range of clique sizes.
    This is the function to use if primarily interested in the total number 
    of cliques.  Also returns a matrix of actual cliques, but the matrix
    may not be complete.

GetAllCliques.m  
    Finds a complete list of cliques within the given range of clique sizes.
    This is really a wrapper for "FindNumCliques.m", which is called twice.

COMPARISON FUNCTIONS...................................................

The functions "BronKerbosch.m" and "maximalCliques.m" are included
just for comparison, to ensure the above functions give sensible results.

Finally, there is "script.m" which is Zach's way of testing the main
functions against the comparison ones.
